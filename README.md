[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/PlasmaPy/hack-week/HEAD)

This repository is used to create a
[binder](https://binder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
environment with open source packages that are likely to be used
during [Plasma Hack Week](https://hack.plasmapy.org/) from
July 11 â€“ July 15, 2022.  Click on the above link to access the
environment.


## Using binder

After clicking on the binder link above, you will be taken to an
environment with much of the software that is necessary for the Hack
Week.  The environment may take a few minutes to initialize.  Once it is
created, you can get to a Jupyter notebook by clicking on the "New"
button and selecting "Python 3".  From there, you can import PlasmaPy by
typing `import plasmapy`.
