This repository is used to house [resources] for th 2022 Plasma Hack Week
and be home for the `hack` package that is developed by the Hack Week
participants.

The [2022 Plasma Hack Week][2022-website] runs from
July 11 - 15, 2022.  The schedule for the event can be found
[here][2022-schedule], and you can register
[here][2022-registration].

The event will be hosted with [Zoom](https://zoom.us/).  Starting
Monday, July 11th, each day of the event will begin at 11:00 am ET
(8:00 am PT, 15:00 UTC).  The following link allows you to register for

registration you will be emailed a link that gives access to every day
of the Hack Week.  This link will be unique to you, so please don't

If you have any questions, then please feel free to email us at
hack@plasmapy.org or post to our [Discord] channel.

## Resources

Event resources can be found in the [resources] subdirectory.  This directory
will contain materials ranging from getting setup background materials
to event tutorials.  Please refer to the resources
[README](./resources/README.md) for more details.

## The `hack` Package

The primary goal of the 2022 Plasma Hack Week is to **train our scientists
so open-source software can thrive throughout the Plasma Community**.  To
do this, the Hack Week and participants will focus on developing a `hack`
package.  The center of the package will focus on developing a plasma
formulary, and additional plasma features will be driven by the
participants interests.  While developing the `hack` package participants
will learn about version control and `git`; the mechanics of GitHub;
packaging code to be used by a wider audience; and how to collaboratively
develop code.

## Using binder

After clicking on the binder link above, you will be taken to an
environment with much of the software that is necessary for the Hack
Week.  The environment may take a few minutes to initialize.  Once it is
created, you can get to a Jupyter notebook by clicking on the "New"
button and selecting "Python 3".  From there, you can import PlasmaPy by
typing `import plasmapy`.
