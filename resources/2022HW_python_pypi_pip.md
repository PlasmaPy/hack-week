# 2022 Hack Week: Python, PyPi, and `pip`

## Getting Python

* The easiest to get Python is to download the installer directly from
  Python's website, https://www.python.org/downloads/, and install.
* Python can also be installed with [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/)
* Versions and end-of-life
    * Python 2.7 reached its end-of-life back in 2020.
    * Python schedules a version's end-of-life to be 5 years from its
      release date.
    * [Python version status](https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches)
* The most recent release of `plasmapy` (`v0.8.1`) requires python 3.8+,
  and we recommend installing python 3.10. 

## What is PyPi?

* The [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/) is the official
  third-party software repository for Python.
* This is the repository `pip` pulls from when installing packages.

## What is `pip`?

* Package Installer for Python (`pip`)
* `pip` is the de facto package-management system for Python.
* `pip`
    * is written in Python
    * is used to install and manage your 3rd party packages
    * pulls packages from PyPI
