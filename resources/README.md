# Plasma Hack Week Resources

This directory contains resources pertinent to the 2022 Plasma Hack Week.
Added resources include, but are not limit to, pre-event background
materials, demo jupyter notebooks, tutorials, etc.

## Pre-Event Materials

1. [Installing `git`](#installing-git)
2. [Installing Python](#installing-python)
3. [Anaconda](#anaconda)
4. [Install your favorite code editor](#install-your-favorite-code-editor)
5. [Installing `plasmapy`](#installing-plasmapy)

### [Installing `git`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
    
`git` is a free open-source version control, and is the backbone to
collaborative open-source software development.  On Day 2 we will
cover how to use `git`, both through a command line interface (CLI)
and built-in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to select code editors.

### [Installing Python](https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/stable/install.html#installing-python)

For the Hack Week we will require Python 3.8+, and recommend
installing Python 3.10.  A Python distribution can be
[downloaded](https://www.python.org/downloads/) directly from
python.org and installed.

### [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

Anaconda is similar to the Python Package Index (PyPI), in that it
is a package distribution hub.  Unlike PyPI, packages listed on
Anaconda are not restricted to just Python packages.

Anaconda has its own package installer `conda`, similar to PyPI's
installer `pip`.  Unlike `pip`, `conda` also has built-in functionality
for managing virtual environments.  For a more detailed write look
to Anaconda's
["Understanding Conda and Pip"](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/understanding-conda-and-pip)
primer.

Anaconda also provides the
[Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/), which
is a desktop GUI which allows you to launch applications and manage conda
packages.

### Install your favorite code editor

During the Hack Week the organizers will be using their Integrated
Development Environment (IDE), i.e. code editor, of choices, so you
will get exposure to the main IDEs out there.  The three IDEs that will be
used are:

* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) by Microsoft, 
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) by JetBrains 
* [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)

On Day 1 we will give a brief overview of each IDE.
