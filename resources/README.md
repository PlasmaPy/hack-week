## Pre-Event Materials

1. [Installing `git`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
    
    `git` is a free open-source version control, and is the backbone to
    collaborative open-source software development.  On Day 2 we will
    cover how to ue `git`.

2. [Installing Python](https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/install.html#installing-python)

    For the Hack Week we will require Python 3.8+, and recommend installing Python 3.10.

3. Install your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE), i.e. your favorite
   code editor.

    During the Hack Week the organizers will be using their IDE of choices, so you
    will get exposure to the main IDEs out there.  The three IDEs that will be
    used are: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) by Microsoft, 
    [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) by JetBrains, and 
    [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/).

    On Day 1 we will give a brief overview of each IDE.
