# The Unix Shell

There are a couple of ways that we can interact with a computer. 

We most often use a graphical user interface (GUI). GUIs are generally 
intuitive, but it's hard to do complicated or repetitive tasks.

A command-line interface (CLI) such as the Unix shell allows us to
automate certain tasks.  There are several different flavors of Unix
shell, though the most common commands are usually the same. The most 
common Unix shell is [`bash`].

There are a few different ways to get help about a command while using a
`bash` shell, though these might differ between computers. Two of the
most common ways are the following two commands:

```shell
man ls
ls --help
```
