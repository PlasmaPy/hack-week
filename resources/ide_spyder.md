# IDE: Spyder

This document describes the basics needed for **HackWeek2022** of The **S**cientific **Py**thon **D**evelopment **E**nvi**r**onment (Spyder)




## How to get it?
[Visit the Spyder download page](https://www.spyder-ide.org/#section-download). Their server should detect if you're on a Mac, Windows PC, or Linux system and serve you up the appropriate download link.
## Installing
The Spyder folks (Spyders?) have a full workup on installation along with a troubleshooting guide, so please visit their [installation page](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/installation.html) and choose the install method that you're comfortable with. They even have a section where you can take Spyder for a test drive without installing it.


## Integration with `git` and linking to GitHub
For the Spyder IDE, we recommend starting with `git` from the command line. The concepts behind `git` and GitHub will be discussed extensively during on Tuesday of the HackWeek.

Once you understand the basic concepts of git from the command line, there exists some functionality for using a graphical interface (gitk) for integrating the use of Spyder with Github.

From the Spyder website:
"The Project pane has basic integration with the Git distributed version control system, just like in the Files pane. You can commit or browse a file, directory or the entire repository via the commands in the context menu.

To use this functionality, the Project must be located in a git repository and the git and gitk commands must be on the system path."
